# README

 Flowing with ruby is a clone type of StackOverflow
 but specifically ask and answer questions of the
 Ruby language. With in our project you can go ahead and Sign Up and Log In. If you Sign Up you can post question and answers on it and have the option to up vote or down vote a question. So the first step was the white boarding and agreeing on the idea. After that it was to create models, controllers and views with most of the logic. We set up a schedule for all the tasks we wanted to complete by and who in the team was completing it.
 After using the white board we brought the wire frame to a more virtual design using Indesign.

  User Stories was to get a new user to the site. After that they are welcomed with How it works, then you can browse questions and even search for answers. the link to our app is on and working on Heroku.

Languages that were used in the project was of coursed Ruby, HTML, CSS, Jquery, Rails, Postgresql. Also used a google search bar API in our questions page.


  Our wish list would be to allow our users to keep track of the questions they asked or answers they posted. Also to add the functionality to the voting but for the answer not just only the questions. Then for allowing users that posted the particular question and answer to be able to edit in it. Lastly would to be allow users to comment on Questions and Answers and edit them as well.
